A CNN consists of a number of convolutional and subsampling layers optionally followed by fully connected layers.  The input to a convolutional layer is a <m>m \text{ x } m \text{ x } r</m> image where <m>m</m> is the height and width of the image and <m>r</m> is the number of channels, e.g. an RGB image has <m>r=3</m>.
